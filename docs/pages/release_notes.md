### üö® API Changes

#### CLI

* New exit code 5 introduced. PMD and CPD will exit now by default with exit code 5, if any processing error
  (e.g. parsing exception, lexing exception or rule exception) occurred. Such processing errors mean, that
  either no violations or duplication for the entire file or for that rule are reported. These cases can be
  considered as false-negatives.

  In any case, the root cause should be investigated. If it's a problem in PMD itself, please create a bug report.

* New CLI parameter `--no-fail-on-processing-error` to ignore processing errors and not exit with code 5. By default,
  a build with processing errors will now fail and with that parameter, the previous behavior can be restored.

#### Deprecated API

* pmd-java
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTResource#getStableName() %} and the corresponding attribute `@StableName`
