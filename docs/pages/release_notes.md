### üöÄ New and noteworthy

#### Collections exposed as XPath attributes

Up to now, all AST node getters would be exposed to XPath, as long as the return type was a primitive (boxed or unboxed), String or Enum. That meant that collections, even of these basic types, were not exposed, so for instance accessing Apex's `ASTUserClass.getInterfaceNames()` to list the interfaces implemented by a class was impossible from XPath, and would require writing a Java rule to check it.

Since this release, PMD will also expose any getter returning a collection of any supported type as a sequence through an XPath attribute. They would require to use apropriate XQuery functions to manipulate the sequence. So for instance, to detect any given `ASTUserClass` in Apex that implements `Queueable`, it is now possible to write:

```xml
/UserClass[@InterfaceNames = 'Queueable']
```

### üö® API Changes

#### CLI

* New exit code 5 introduced. PMD and CPD will exit now by default with exit code 5, if any processing error
  (e.g. parsing exception, lexing exception or rule exception) occurred. Such processing errors mean, that
  either no violations or duplication for the entire file or for that rule are reported. These cases can be
  considered as false-negatives.

  In any case, the root cause should be investigated. If it's a problem in PMD itself, please create a bug report.

* New CLI parameter `--no-fail-on-processing-error` to ignore processing errors and not exit with code 5. By default,
  a build with processing errors will now fail and with that parameter, the previous behavior can be restored.

#### Deprecated API

* pmd-java
  * {% jdoc !!java::lang.java.ast.ASTResource#getStableName() %} and the corresponding attribute `@StableName`
