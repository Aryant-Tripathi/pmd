### üöÄ New and noteworthy

### üåü Rule Changes

* {%rule java/bestpractices/JUnitTestsShouldIncludeAssert %} and {% rule java/bestpractices/JUnitTestContainsTooManyAsserts %}
  have a new property named `extraAssertMethodNames`. With this property, you can configure which additional static
  methods should be considered as valid verification methods. This allows to use custom mocking or assertion libraries.
