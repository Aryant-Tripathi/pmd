### üöÄ New and noteworthy

#### New: Java 23 Support

This release of PMD brings support for Java 23. There are no new standard language features,
but a couple of preview language features:

* [JEP 455: Primitive Types in Patterns, instanceof, and switch (Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/455)
* [JEP 476: Module Import Declarations (Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/476)
* [JEP 477: Implicitly Declared Classes and Instance Main Methods (Third Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/477)
* [JEP 482: Flexible Constructor Bodies (Second Preview)](https://openjdk.org/jeps/482)

Note that String Templates (introduced as preview in Java 21 and 22) are not supported anymore in Java 23,
see [JDK-8329949](https://bugs.openjdk.org/browse/JDK-8329949) for details.

In order to analyze a project with PMD that uses these preview language features,
you'll need to enable it via the environment variable `PMD_JAVA_OPTS` and select the new language
version `23-preview`:

    export PMD_JAVA_OPTS=--enable-preview
    pmd check --use-version java-23-preview ...

Note: Support for Java 21 preview language features have been removed. The version "21-preview"
are no longer available.

    because this is an implementation class that should not be used directly.
