### üö® API Changes
* pmd-jsp

    because this is an implementation class that should not be used directly.
* pmd-plsql
  * {%jdoc plsql::lang.plsql.ast.PLSQLParserImpl#MergeUpdateClausePrefix() %} is deprecated. This production is
    not used anymore and will be removed. Note: The whole parser implementation class has been deprecated since 7.3.0,
    as it is supposed to be internalized.
* pmd-velocity
  * {%jdoc velocity::lang.velocity.ast.VtlParserImpl %} is deprecated now. It should have been package-private
    because this is an implementation class that should not be used directly.
* pmd-visualforce
  * {%jdoc visualforce::lang.visualforce.ast.VfParserImpl %} is deprecated now. It should have been package-private
    because this is an implementation class that should not be used directly.
