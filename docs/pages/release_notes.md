### New and noteworthy

### Fixed Issues

### API Changes

#### PMD CLI

* PMD now supports a new `--use-version` flag, which receives a language-version pair (such as `java-8` or `apex-54`).
This supersedes the usage of `-language` / `-l` and `-version` / `-v`, allowing for multiple versions to be set in a single run.
PMD 7 will completely remove support for `-language` and `-version` in favor of this new flag.

* Support for `-V` is being deprecated in favor of `--verbose` in preparation for PMD 7.
In PMD 7, `-v` will enable verbose mode and `-V` will show the PMD version for consistency with most Unix/Linux tools.

* Support for `-min` is being deprecated in favor of `--minimum-priority` for consistency with most Unix/Linux tools, where `-min` would be equivalent to `-m -i -n`.

#### CPD CLI

* CPD now supports using `-d` or `--dir` as an alias to `--files`, in favor of consistency with PMD.
PMD 7 will remove support for `--files` in favor of these new flags.

#### Linux run.sh parameters

* Using `run.sh cpdgui` will now warn about it being deprecated. Use `run.sh cpd-gui` instead.

* The old designer (`run.sh designerold`) is completely deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7. Switch to the new JavaFX designer: `run.sh designer`.

* The old visual AST viewer (`run.sh bgastviewer`) is completely deprecated and will be removed in PMD 7. Switch to the new JavaFX designer: `run.sh designer` for a visual tool, or use `run.sh ast-dump` for a text-based aleternative.

#### Deprecated API

The following APIs have been marked as deprecated for removal in PMD 7:

- {% jdoc core::PMD %} and {% jdoc core::PMD.StatusCode %} - PMD 7 will ship with a revamped CLI split from pmd-core. To programatically launch analysis you can use {% jdoc core::PmdAnalysis %}.

- {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#isStressTest() %} and {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setStressTest(boolean) %} - Will be removed with no replacement.
- {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#isBenchmark() %} and {% jdoc !!core::PMDConfiguration#setBenchmark(boolean) %} - Will be removed with no replacement, the CLI will still support it.
