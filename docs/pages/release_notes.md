### New and noteworthy

### Fixed Issues

### API Changes

#### Deprecated APIs

##### For removal

* {% jdoc !!apex::lang.apex.ast.ApexRootNode#getApexVersion() %} has been deprecated for removal. The version returned is
  always `Version.CURRENT`, as the apex compiler integration doesn't use additional information which Apex version
  actually is used. Therefore, this method can't be used to determine the Apex version of the project
  that is being analyzed.
