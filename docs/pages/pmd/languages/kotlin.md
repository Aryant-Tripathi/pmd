[Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/) support in PMD is based on the official grammar from <https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-spec>.

{% include language_info.html name='Kotlin' id='kotlin' implementation='kotlin::lang.kotlin.JspLanguageModule' supports_pmd=true supports_cpd=true %}

Java-based rules and XPath-based rules are supported.

{% include note.html content="Kotlin support has **experimental** stability level, meaning no compatibility should
be expected between even incremental releases. Any functionality can be added, removed or changed without
warning." %}
