> [Apex](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.apexcode.meta/apexcode/apex_dev_guide.htm) is a strongly
> typed, object-oriented programming language that allows developers to execute flow and
> transaction control statements on the Salesforce Platform server, in conjunction with calls to the API.

## Metrics framework

In order to use code metrics in Apex, use the metrics constants in {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.metrics.ApexMetrics %},
together with {% jdoc core::lang.metrics.MetricsUtil %}.

## Multifile Analysis

Integration happens in {% jdoc apex::lang.apex.multifile.ApexMultifileAnalysis %}. It uses
[ApexLink](https://github.com/nawforce/apex-link). For detailed information, see also [Apexlink POC #2830](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/pull/2830).

## Language Properties

See [Apex language properties](pmd_languages_configuration.html#apex-language-properties)

## Parser

We use Jorje, the Apex parsers that is shipped within the Apex Language Server. This is part of
the [Salesforce Extensions for VS Code](https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode).

We take the binary from <https://github.com/forcedotcom/salesforcedx-vscode/tree/develop/packages/salesforcedx-vscode-apex/out>
and provide it as a maven dependency (see [pmd-apex-jorje](https://github.com/pmd/pmd/tree/master/pmd-apex-jorje)).
